Project Title: Trailer Nailer

1. What was accomplished during the week
- Built the basic HTML pages such that the login screen and the game screen.
- For the game screen, display a sample video from YouTube in 10 random seconds using YouTube API and prevent the user from controlling the video.

2. Challenges and issues team faced during the week
- YouTube API did not support link disablement, hence a simple HTML trick that uses a transparent "block" must be used to prevent users from accessing the source video through YouTube and getting its information.

3. Goals for the next week
- Build a database collections of multiple movie trailers of different categories and enable the game screen to display a list of videos mined from the database consequently.
- Build an index page that allows users to access the main menu to go to the game or to access their profile.
- Build a connection between the login page and index page.
