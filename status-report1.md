Project Title: Nailer Trailer

1. What was accomplished during the week

2. Challenges and issues team faced during the week

Huynh Tran: I was able to build rudimentary answer choices and scoring system. However, they are far from being operable. First off, clicking on answers has not made changes we need in the video (It can stop the video, but fail to reload it or make it load a new video, simply because we only have one video in stock). Secondly, when clicking the right answer, the score increases, however, it does not prevent the answer from being clicked again, which triggers the score to increase once more. Therefore, the score can be increased indefinitely.

3. Goals for the next week

Huynh Tran: These features need to be fixed once we have a working database of videos and answers, which would bring huge changes to my initial design as well. In order to do so, we need to build a choice system that interacts with the database (fetching answers for specific video, knowing which is the correct one), and is able to load new video from the database, without resetting the timer and allowing user to click multiple answers for one video.
