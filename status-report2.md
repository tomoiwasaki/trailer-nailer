Project Title: Trailer Nailer

1. What was accomplished during the week
- Built heroku web server that is connected to MongoDB to store information of movies.
- Added a good number of movies into the database for the game to use.
- Allow game screen to fetch information from MongoDB to get a list of movies to be displayed.
- Basic CSS/HTML for "Challenge Your Friends" screen created, using bootstrap.

2. Challenges and issues team faced during the week
- Getting stuck while finding a way to change video immediately after a choice is made by the user. Last resort is to fetch a new page from the server but it will be a very inefficient solution. (Edit: Resolved!!!)

3. Goals for the next week
- Resolve the video switching issue. (Edit: Resolved!!!)
- Perfect the score and timing system.
- Built the "Challenge your friend" page so that it functions as expected.
- Add more movies to the library.
