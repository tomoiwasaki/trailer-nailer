COMP20 Final Project Proposal

by: Minh D. Nguyen, Huynh Tran, Tomo Iwasaki, Arpan Gurung

Project title: Recognisong

Problem statement:
- Create a website that allows user to play a song recognition game. In each play, user will watch a short part of a music video and identify the music video.
- The website will allow the user to choose to do the quiz on songs of the same artist, same genre, or just random songs.
- The website will allow users to challenge each other to find the “true” fan of a band or an artist!

How to solve the problem:
- Use YouTube API to get MVs from YouTube and the information of each song.
- Use server-side database to store user’s information such as authentication information and high scores, and song’s information such as URL, song name, artist name, and popularity.
- Use client-side storage to retain user’s login information.
- Send email/SMS and push notification whenever someone receives a challenge from others.

Features that we will implement:
- Server side framework.
- Client side framwork.
- Front-end framework.
- Send emails, SMSs, and push notifications.
- Charts and graphs.

Data the prototype will be collecting:
- Song’s information from YouTube.
- User’s email and phone number (optional).

Algorithms or special technique:
- Selection algorithm to select songs based on user preferences. (e.g. genre, local bands only, etc.)
- Randomized algorithm to choose a random part of the MV to play and to randomized a playlist.
