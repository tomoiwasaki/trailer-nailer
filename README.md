1. Project title: MV Master? Music Expert? Recognisong? 

2. Problem statement:
- Create a website that allows user to play a song recognition game. In each play, user will watch a short part of a music video and identify the music video.
- The website will allow the user to choose to do quiz on songs of the same artist, same genre, or just random songs.
- The website will allow users to challenge each other to find the “true” fan of a band or an artist!

3. How to solve the problem:
- Use YouTube API to get MVs from YouTube and the information of each song.
- Use server-side database to store user’s information such as authentication information and high scores, and song’s information such as URL, song name, artist name, and popularity.
- Use client-side storage to retain user’s login information.
- Send email/SMS and push notification whenever someone receives a challenge from others.

4. Features that we will implement:
- Server side framework.
- Client side framwork.
- Front-end framework.
- Send emails, SMSs, and push notifications.

5. Data the prototype will be collecting:
- Song’s information from YouTube.
- User’s email and phone number (optional).

6. Algorithms or special technique:
- Selection algorithm to select songs based on current location and user preferences. (e.g. genre, local bands only, etc.)
- Randomized algorithm to choose a random part of the MV to play and to randomized a playlist.
